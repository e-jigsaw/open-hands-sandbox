# Summary

The user requested to display "hello" on the webpage of an Astro project.

# Steps

1.  Installed dependencies using `npm install`.
2.  Located the main page file `src/pages/index.astro` and attempted to modify it to display "hello".
3.  Tried different approaches to insert "hello" into the file, including replacing the existing content and inserting it at a specific line.
4.  Encountered issues with string replacement due to content mismatches and multiple occurrences of the target string.
5.  Successfully inserted "hello" inside the `Layout` component in `index.astro`.
6.  Ran the development server using `npm run dev -- --port 50350 --host 0.0.0.0`.
7.  Encountered an error on the `/docs/[...slug].astro` page related to rendering.
8.  Fixed the error by adding `export const prerender = true;` to the `/docs/[...slug].astro` file.
9.  Attempted to push the changes to GitHub and create a pull request.
10. Created a new branch `feat/add-prerender-docs`, added the changes, committed them, and pushed the branch to the remote repository.
11. Encountered authentication issues with the GitHub token and was unable to create a pull request using the API.
12. Provided the user with the link to create a pull request manually.
