# Summary

The session began with a request to execute `npm run dev` for preview. However, the interaction quickly shifted to troubleshooting a pull request on GitHub. The primary goal was to remove a hardcoded port setting from `astro.config.mjs`, push the changes to a new branch, create a pull request, and then merge it. The pull request was successfully created (PR #5), but repeated attempts to change its status from "draft" to "ready for review" using the GitHub API failed. Despite sending the correct PATCH requests, the API consistently reported the pull request as remaining in draft mode, preventing the merge. The session concluded with the agent unable to merge the pull request due to this persistent draft status.
