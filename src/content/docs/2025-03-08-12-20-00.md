# Context

This session focused on enhancing the repository's quality assurance and documentation practices by implementing automated build checks for pull requests and improving documentation standards.

# Activities

## Documentation Updates

- Created PR #24 with:
  - Instructions for writing session summaries
  - Template for external documentation
  - Build verification using `npm run build`

## GitHub Actions Implementation

- Developed a GitHub Actions workflow for PR build checks
- Core workflow components:
  - Node.js 20 environment setup with npm caching
  - Dependencies installation
  - Build verification process
- Note: Manual workflow file addition required due to token scope limitations

# Technical Implementation

## Build Process

- Verified build process functionality:
  - `npm install` completes successfully
  - `npm run build` generates output without errors
  - Documentation pages render as expected

## CI/CD Configuration

- Workflow configuration details:
  - Triggers: PR events (open, sync, reopen)
  - Environment: Node.js 20 with npm cache
  - Core steps: checkout, setup, install, build

# Issues and Resolution

## Token Permission Challenge

- Issue: Unable to push workflow file due to missing workflow scope
- Resolution: Workflow file to be added manually with proper token permissions

# Next Actions

- Manual addition of GitHub Actions workflow file
- Review and merge of PR #24 documentation updates
- Verification of PR build check workflow functionality
