# Summary

This session focused on configuring the Astro project for deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

# Initial Setup

The user requested to deploy the project to Cloudflare Workers, referring to the Astro documentation.

# Steps Taken

1.  **Installed the Cloudflare Adapter:** The `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter was installed using `npm install @astrojs/cloudflare`.
2.  **Created `wrangler.json`:** A `wrangler.json` file was created with basic configuration for Cloudflare Workers. The user needs to replace a placeholder with their actual Cloudflare Account ID.
3.  **Created `.assetsignore`:** An `.assetsignore` file was created to prevent the server-side code (`_worker.js`) from being published.
4. **Git and Pull Request:** Created a new branch, committed the changes, and opened a draft pull request on GitHub.

# Issues Encountered

Attempts to access the Cloudflare documentation and a GitHub template for `wrangler.json` using `web_read` and `browser` tools failed due to network issues. A basic `wrangler.json` was created manually as a workaround.

# Pull Request
