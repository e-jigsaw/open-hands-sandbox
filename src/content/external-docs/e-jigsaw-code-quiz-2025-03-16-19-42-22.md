title: Fix TypeScript Build and Add Cloudflare Deployment
---

# Session Overview

This session was initiated to address TypeScript compilation issues during the build process and set up Cloudflare Pages deployment for a React TypeScript project. The main objectives were to:
- Fix TypeScript compilation errors preventing successful builds
- Configure the project for Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Ensure proper type checking without file emission

# Key Activities

- Added TypeScript configuration files
  - Created `tsconfig.json` with React+TS settings
  - Created `tsconfig.node.json` for Vite config
- Modified build process
  - Updated build script from `tsc && vite build` to `tsc --noEmit && vite build`
  - Successfully tested build with new configuration
- Set up Cloudflare deployment
  - Added wrangler as a dev dependency
  - Created deploy script in package.json
  - Configured `wrangler.json` with proper build output directory
- Created pull request
  - Pushed changes to new branch `fix-typescript-build`
  - Created draft PR with detailed description

# Technical Learnings

- TypeScript Configuration
  - Using `--noEmit` flag prevents TypeScript from generating output files while still performing type checking
  - Separate TypeScript configs needed for app code (`tsconfig.json`) and build tools (`tsconfig.node.json`)
- Cloudflare Pages Setup
  - Wrangler requires `pages_build_output_dir` to correctly identify build artifacts
  - Build output directory must match Vite's configured output directory (`dist`)

# Challenges and Solutions

- TypeScript Build Issues
  - Problem: Build failing due to TypeScript compilation
  - Solution: Separated type checking from build process using `--noEmit` flag
  - Benefit: Maintains type safety without file emission conflicts

- Cloudflare Pages Configuration
  - Problem: Needed to specify build output location for Pages
  - Solution: Added `pages_build_output_dir` to `wrangler.json`
  - Ensures Cloudflare Pages can locate and deploy the correct files

# Observations and Patterns

- Build Process
  - Type checking should run before build to catch errors early
  - Separating type checking from transpilation provides cleaner build process
- Project Structure
  - Clear separation between application and build tool configurations
  - Deployment configuration kept in root directory for visibility

# Future Considerations

- Potential Improvements
  - Add build caching to improve build times
  - Consider implementing CI/CD pipeline
  - Add environment configuration for different deployment stages
- Areas for Investigation
  - Performance optimization opportunities
  - Asset optimization for Cloudflare Pages
  - Automated testing integration

# Final Thoughts

The session successfully addressed the core TypeScript build issues while setting up a robust deployment pipeline to Cloudflare Pages. The separation of type checking from the build process provides a cleaner and more maintainable solution.

Key takeaways:
- TypeScript configuration is crucial for project maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns in build process improves reliability
- Proper deployment configuration ensures smooth deployment process

The changes lay a solid foundation for future development and deployment workflows. The next steps could focus on optimizing the build process and implementing automated testing.
