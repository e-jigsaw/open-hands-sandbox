# Summary

Created Astro pages from Markdown files in `docs/`.

# Steps

1.  Explored the `docs/` directory.
2.  Created the `src/content/config.ts` file to define the content collection schema.
3.  Created the `src/layouts/DocsLayout.astro` file for the layout.
4.  Created the `src/pages/docs/[...slug].astro` file to generate pages.
5.  Moved the Markdown files from `docs/` to `src/content/docs/`.
6.  Added frontmatter (title, description, pubDate) to the Markdown files.
7.  Ran `npm install` and `npm run dev` to verify the setup.
