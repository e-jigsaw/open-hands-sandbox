# Tasks Completed

1.  Updated the homepage (`src/pages/index.astro`) to dynamically display links to documentation pages.
2.  Removed the redundant "Docs" link.
3.  Created a pull request for these changes.

# Issues Encountered

1.  Encountered a rendering error ("Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'render')") when trying to access individual documentation pages via `src/pages/docs/[...slug].astro`. The issue is likely related to how Astro is processing the content or a potential bug.

# Next Steps

1.  Investigate and resolve the rendering issue with the documentation pages.
