# Session Summary: Add PR Build Check and Documentation

## Overview
In this session, we worked on improving the repository's documentation and adding automated build checks for pull requests.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Updates (PR #24)
- Created instructions for writing session summaries
- Added template for external documentation
- Verified that the documentation builds correctly with `npm run build`

### GitHub Actions Workflow (Manual Addition Required)
- Created a simple GitHub Actions workflow for PR build checks
- Workflow includes:
  - Node.js setup
  - Dependencies installation
  - Build verification
- Note: Manual addition required due to token permission limitations

## Technical Details

### Build Process Verification
- Successfully tested `npm install` and `npm run build`
- Build completes without errors
- Documentation pages render correctly

### GitHub Actions Configuration
- Workflow triggers on PR events (open, sync, reopen)
- Uses Node.js 20 with npm caching
- Basic build verification without dev server tests

## Next Steps
1. Manually add the GitHub Actions workflow file with proper token permissions
2. Review and merge PR #24 for documentation updates
3. Test the PR build check workflow on future pull requests

## Issues and Solutions
- **Issue**: Unable to push workflow file due to token permissions
- **Solution**: Manual addition of workflow file required using a token with workflow scope
